# Small-Java-Game
A small Bullet Hell game made within Java, in late 2019 to early 2020
The game mimics other games which had a stationary screen, with enemies descending at the player. Included are powerups, a pause menu, round counter, high-score tracking, and a dynamic background. Almost the entire game was implemented from scratch, and almost the entirety of the logic is handled within one java file. This was the first step I took into creating games, was done in my free time during winter break.
